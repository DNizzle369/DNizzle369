- 👋 Hi, I’m @DNizzle369. I'm a crane operator by day right now, but I am trying to find my way into the IT world.
- 👀 I’m interested in all things computers. Coding, networking, gaming, and building custom PCs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that I don't know crap about computers. I am attempting to learn Python on my own ATM, and intend to learn a few more languages after.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing ATM, but I am open to suggestions, comments, and project ideas that will further my understanding in coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: daniel_p46@hotmail.com
- My goal is to be a software or network engineer in the end. If you have any tips, pointers, advice, or tricks I look forward to hearing them.
